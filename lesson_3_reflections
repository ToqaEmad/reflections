When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

when I am working from different pc's or when working with a group of people 
on the same project

 
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

to control what changes are needed on my local pc 

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you 
use one instead of another?

fork: clonning in GitHub enviroment, 
clone: cloning from GitHub , or clonning in local pc 
branches: copying/editing on the code/file in the local pc 

fork will only be used in the GitHub enviroment, clone and branches to deal 
with files on my local pc/laptop
