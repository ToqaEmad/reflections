*When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

when I am working from different pc's or when working with a group of people 
on the same project

 
*Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

to control what changes are needed on my local pc 

*Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you 
use one instead of another?

fork: clonning in GitHub enviroment, 
clone: cloning from GitHub , or clonning in local pc 
branches: copying/editing on the code/file in the local pc 

fork will only be used in the GitHub enviroment, clone and branches to deal 
with files on my local pc/laptop

*What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote 
stored locally?

to keep updated even if you're working offline on the project 

*How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier,
and what would be harder? 

This would be harder, starting from the need to comapre files , and decide 
what branches are there and which one to merge and etc  

*When would you want to make changes in a seprate branch rather than directly
in master? What benefits does each approach have?

If I'm attempting on adding/editing major changes, or try a whole new 
idea/approach I would make a new branch, but else If I'm working on minor small issues I would edit on master
