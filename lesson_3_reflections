When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

when I am working from different pc's or when working with a group of people 
on the same project

 
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

to control what changes are needed on my local pc
