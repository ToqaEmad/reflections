What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

starts the git system, to save commits on the file, as a version control system

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

staging area is where you sort your commits, and it helps organizing your 
commits 

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per 
logical change ?

move the files of the same logical change to the staging area , commit them
and then add the next batch along. Meaning: using the staging area in grouping
the commits.
